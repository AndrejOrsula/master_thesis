\section{Joint Trajectory Controller}\label{app:joint_trajectory_controller}

In order to enable execution of planned motions for robot manipulators inside Ignition Gazebo, a standard joint trajectory controller was implemented as a system plugin and contributed upstream. In its simplest, it provides simultaneous control of multiple joints, which can be used to follow trajectories generated by a motion planning framework such as MoveIt 2. Each trajectory consists of discrete temporal points that each contain per-joint targets for position, velocity, acceleration and effort. Control of each joint is accomplished by the use of PID controllers for position and velocity control. Effort computed by these controllers is combined with feed-forward effort from the trajectory itself and then applied to the joint for physics computations.

In this work, trajectories generated by MoveIt 2 are followed with position-controlled joints, where PID gains for both UR5 and Panda robots were manually tuned.
