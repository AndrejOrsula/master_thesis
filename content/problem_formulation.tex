\chapter{Problem Formulation}\label{ch:problem_formulation}



% When describing environment:
% However, the
% discrimination between those two components (agent
% and environment) is not always straightforward and
% depends on the application. For example, in applica-
% tions such as bipedal walking and UAV control, the
% environment is assumed to include the motors of the
% robot.

% Mention this here
% Some problems are better solved with other traditional method istead of RL. (when talking about control of joint vs cartesian pose)
