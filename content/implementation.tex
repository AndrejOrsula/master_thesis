% % Mention something about reproducibility, and that Docker image was created to easy this
% On the other hand, reproducibility is an underestimated issue in
% RL and not many researchers have tried to dig into the issue.
% It is not easy to reproduce results from many state-of-the-art
% papers since the implementation details were either missing
% or incomplete. The situation is even worse when coupled with
% the instability that RL algorithms currently suffer.
